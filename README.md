# JPX-TSE-Stock-Prediction
Quantitative analysis and predictive modeling of JPX stocks for portfolio optimization.

## Description

Success in any financial market depends on identifying solid investment opportunities. When a stock is undervalued, it’s time to buy; when it’s overvalued, it may be time to sell. Traditionally, these decisions were made manually by financial professionals, but with the rise of technology, quantitative trading has become accessible to retail investors.

This project participates in the **[JPX Tokyo Stock Exchange Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/jpx-tokyo-stock-exchange-prediction)** competition hosted by **Japan Exchange Group (JPX)** and supported by **AlpacaJapan Co., Ltd.**. The goal is to build predictive models that rank approximately 2,000 Japanese stocks by their expected returns and evaluate performance based on the return difference between the top and bottom 200 stocks.

The dataset includes a wide range of financial indicators and historical market data from the Japanese stock market, enabling participants to design, train, and validate quantitative trading strategies. All top-performing models will be made public to encourage collaboration and innovation in quantitative finance.
